                <p>This website is simply a passion project. I have loved the warrior class fantasy my entire life. Most Cataclysm websites seem to have spotty information at best, thus <span class="armshaven">Arms Haven</span> was born!</p>
                <h3>What's different about this from other websites?</h3>
                <p>Sourcing<br>Sourcing<br>and Sourcing..</p>
                <p>The classic wow routine of finding information on the internet is as follows:<br><br>-Find a website<br>-Fact check this against other websites<br>-Hope theres some sort of information consistency</p>
                <h4>Spoiler alert</h4>
                <p>There is no consistency in the information, there is no sourcing, and most importantly there is no accountability.</p>

                <h2><img src="./media/mortalstrike.jpg" alt="Cataclysm Icon">Our Mission Statement</h2>
                <p>I want this to be your one stop shop for all things Arms Warrior. I will spend countless hours rummaging through the outdated websites of 2010 and onward, to provide you with the information you deserve.</p>
                <p>We don't need logins, we don't need hundreds of pages to dig through, we need information that's appropriately sourced and quick to access.</p>
                <p>Simple and clean, nothing more, nothing less.</p>
